00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
There is nothing wrong
with dreaming.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Entitlement!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You need to have the right to dream.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If not, you are just going to be
reduced to smithereens.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You can’t stock a bottle of liquor

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but you do have good foresight,
captain.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If we head beyond the next ten
miles,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
we are going to
cross Krishnapatanam.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If we go another 50 miles, we are
going to leave the country behind.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There’s no one who will stop us.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
He will not come.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He will come.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Who?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The heir of Krishnakota.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Is he that brave?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He belongs to the bloodline that

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
bravely stood up against the rifles
of the British army.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
His grandfather was a crook
who cheated crooks such as you.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
His uncle, was the first amongst the
thieves such as you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well then, who is he?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Why bother saying it?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You are going to see it yourself.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Captain, there’s someone
heading this way.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Shoot him.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Boys alert!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Your super hero chapter is over.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This isn’t the climax of the story.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is merely an introduction.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Your countdown starts now.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(On TV)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
There should be tears in the
fiery eyes of the rich men. (On TV)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The bitter fire of hate
in the hearts

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of the poor must be
calmed down. (On TV)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I use my strength and intelligence
for this very purpose. (On TV)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you do the same, I would
be happy. (On TV)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I am going to prove that there are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
no separate laws for the rich
and the poor. (On TV)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Mom!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Humming song)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Mom!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Mom!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Mom!

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Mom!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I had a wonderful dream, mother.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Here, rub a tomato on yourself. You
are going to become even more fair.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You and your stupid curd and tomato!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I came to you because I had such a
wonderful dream in the morning.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And you’ve completely
ruined my mood and enthusiasm.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Son, I am really sorry.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You should have told me
that it was about a dream.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Fine, tell me your dream.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Tell me.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Was it about love or
action or emotion?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Introduction.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Super!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It’s awesome!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A hero needs to have that
kind of persona.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
All the heroes who have mounted a
horse such as superstar,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
megastar and power star.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You are going to be a huge star!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Forget about star, he is not capable
of being a background artist either.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It’s not wrong to dream, son.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Entitlement!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you dream a dream that you
have no right to...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
you will end up in ruin.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It’s the same dialogue.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
With a gun in a dream...
with a bell in reality

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If you cook biryani in your dream,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
your hunger in real life
won’t be satiated.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You need to come back to reality.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You are a stickler for reality. Did
that make you the prime minister?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
He is a veterinary doctor.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Yes, the very same animals are
the ones that feed us.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Fathers should advice their sons on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
following their dreams
and chasing their passion...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
...Instead, you ask me to do a
course in Ameerpet, go and

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
work in the US, etc.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
From tomorrow onwards,
you don’t have to do any course.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Come to our clinic ....

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
...and put the thermometer
in the animals.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Why don’t you deal with
that thermometer?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Sharada!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
My Mother...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and my Father

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Did not freeze the frame about them

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Actually I have to introduce Subbu

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Subbu?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Subhadra?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Subhadra?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Subhadra?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Stop yelling.
-Your mother on Phone.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What’s going on?
Haven’t you woken up, yet?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I am up.
-Get ready.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Today, a potential groom is
coming to meet you.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Mom, I don’t want you to fix me up
with an alliance suddenly.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Do you want me to carry this
message to your father?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That is why I told him not to
let you stay in Hyderabad.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That phone is mine.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You come to Mumbai

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Okay, I will get ready.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Hello?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Mars, guard the wicket properly.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Hey, throw the ball properly.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Subhadra is going to be meeting a
potential groom today.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yes, I heard that Subhadra is going
to be seeing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a potential groom today.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yes.Subhadra is going to be meeting
a potential groom today.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Oh! Is it?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They say it’s an
alliance from the US.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And apparently, the potential groom
earns more than 4 lakhs per month.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Oh! Really?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Hurry up and get ready.
It’s going to be late.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Grandma...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
do we have sweets at home?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I ordered for them on Swiggy.
It should be here any minute now.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Hi.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Hi.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
She didn’t pay you?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Pay?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I thought it best to meet the
potential bride with sweets rather

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
than come empty-handed.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Oh? I am so sorry.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Actually, looking at your T-shirt, I
thought you were

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Swiggy delivery boy.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Judging from my glasses, didn’t you
guess that I might be the groom?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Madam, Swiggy.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Okay, thank you.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It’s already been paid for, madam.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Black T-shirt...it’s my favorite.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I am sorry.
-It’s okay.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Let’s start fresh?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So...

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You are Subhadra, right?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Why did you get the Swiggy delivery
boy in and made him sit in the hall?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The potential groom is going to
be here any minute.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Grandma!
He is the groom.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Oh dear! Your T-shirt made me
misunderstand you.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It’s okay, grandma.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I was wrong to have
worn this T-shirt.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Let me get you some coffee.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Well...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You are...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Here’s your coffee.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Thank you.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Put this inside.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Well...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Sorry...sorry.... sorry...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It’s okay... It’s okay.
you please relax.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Sit down.
Sit down.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It looks like nothing is
working out for me today.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Don’t be disheartened, Son. I will
get you another cup of coffee.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It’s okay.
Let’s start fresh.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Let me come to the point directly.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You look much more pretty in person
than in the photographs.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Biscuit!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Grandma! Apparently, he wants
biscuits served with coffee as well.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Who is he?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
He is the most useless person
in the apartment.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
What is it?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Do you want the ball?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Go and play.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Well, where were we?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You were telling me how
beautiful I am.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Even you are very handsome
and good to look at.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Thanks.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If he is the hero, who am I?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
How dare you address the
groom disrespectfully?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Why are you fighting because of me?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You are too easy with words.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Of course, I am. What else can I do?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Chill...!
-What else can we do?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You..!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Damn it!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
One more.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Coffee is ready.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Great timing, sir!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Arjun, do you want some coffee?
-No, grandma.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
He just had one.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
What? You think he is
okay with just one?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
He has coffee at least two to
three times a day.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So, all this has been going on
with your approval?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Good then.
I shall take my leave.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
When you come back, please
bring your parents.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Why bother?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This behavior isn’t really
appropriate in front of them.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I shall take my leave.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
What? There’s more?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Let’s start fresh.
-Get lost!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Arjun, do you want some coffee?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
No, grandma... Not right now.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I’ll have it later.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
What’s going on with him? Why didn’t
he have coffee before he left?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Hey, come.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
"The star of the night sky is
perched on the ground."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
"Time has stopped because of
this ravishing beauty."

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
"The arrow of love has pierced me."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"The life that was mine has now
become about you."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"This little heart of mine has seen

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you on the silver screen
and fallen in love."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
"It demands that I never
shut my eyes

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and to keep constantly
looking at you."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
"I found the true Telugu beauty in

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
you. My heart began to celebrate."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Well...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Thank you.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
No, No.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I am your neighbor; not some labor.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Oh shit.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.
-It’s okay.z

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I don't know that...
-Give her money back

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Bye!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Arjun.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Flat 402.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
"My youth is floating up in
the air like a kite."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
See this fur coat...
This fur coat is...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Do you remember me?
I am your neighbor.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Dad?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Yeah, my dad.
-Dad, she is our neighbor.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Hi... nice to meet you.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Go away.
-Why is he going overboard?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Dad, come fast.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Hi.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Dad, sit in the back. I’ll drive.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
You sit in the back. I’ll drive.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
"Up until now, I don’t think the
heart has ever heard itself beat."

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
"Up until yesterday, I don’t think

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
my dreams knew that they could
be this colorful."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"I don’t even remember what today
is or even the day of the week"

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
"My watch stopped running."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Dad...dad....
It’s time for the clinic.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I will be in the car.
Come soon.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
God, why is he torturing me?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"You and me beside each other is
like a celebration."

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
"You have made every frame in this
life more beautiful."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
"I found the true Telugu
beauty in you."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
"My heart began to celebrate."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
"My youth is floating up in
the air like a kite."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
"Be it tomorrow or the day after,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
very soon, my journey is
going to be with you."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"My love"

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
"Oh baby you are my love"

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
"You are my love"

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"Oh baby you are my love"

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Son, when you become a hero, where

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
do you think we should

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
purchase a house?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You tell me, mother.
Jubilee Hills or Banjara Hills?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Where does Mahesh Babu stay?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
In Jubilee Hills.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
If that’s the case, let’s purchase a
house at Jubilee Hills.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
People like you are the ones who

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
count their chickens before
the eggs hatch.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
"Slowly and slowly, you began to

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
reach out to me and we
started getting close."

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
"I moved closer and closer to you.
And now I lie in your embraces."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
"I wonder when we crossed
the boundaries of shyness."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"I’ve finally gotten my
sweetest first kiss."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
"I sent myself into the heart of the
beloved who was waiting for me."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
"Walked on the path of joy and
celebration,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We have signed each of
ourselves to the other."

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Oh my god!
In the clinic!

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Father, there are some
irregularities somewhere.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
What do you think we should do?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
If you get rid of your irregular
behavior, that would be enough.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This is a clinic.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It would be a very disgusting here.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Let’s go, dear.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
"Be it tomorrow or the day after,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
very soon, my journey is
going to be with you."

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
"My love"

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
"Oh baby you are my love"

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
"You are my love"

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
"Oh baby you are my love"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
After you become a superstar ..
Half of your remuneration is mine.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Bye!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Hey, watch out!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What happened ?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Shh!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The commissioner is dead.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The only one person has left.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
We have to send gun to Hyderabad

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Why so serious?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Hey...

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
are you going to the audition?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Yes, uncle.
-All the best.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Thanks, uncle.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Arjun, give this to children,
please?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
All the best, Hero.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
All the best, Hero.
-Thank you.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Don’t keep introducing me every day
and irritating me.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Hurry up and get on the bike.
Ravi is waiting.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Please drive slowly...

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Why?
-My hairstyle will be ruined.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Hurry up and go.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Just because he has a bit of hair!

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
If the director suggests to be
paired with one heroine,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
don’t be in a haste to agree.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
There needs to be a minimum of two
heroines in our movies.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Tell them that it doesn’t matter if
the heroine can act or not,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
what matters is that she
must be beautiful.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Why are you so late?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
You told me that it adds to the
hero’s persona if he is late.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
That works only for the audio
function. Not for the audition.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Hurry up.
The director is waiting.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Come...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Let’s go.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Let’s go.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Wait.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Hello, sir.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Who are you?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Sir, he came for the audition.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Do it!

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Get the light on the left, please.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Camera, little to the right.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
My right profile is better, sir.
Let’s call action

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Out!
Get out!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I will talk... you hang
on the phone.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Hey, I’ve seen this
posture somewhere.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Brother...

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
is this audition for a
Hero character?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Yes, right!
Yes, right!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Anil, sir...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You do a fantastic job with regards
mannerisms, energy

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and elevations in your movies.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Take a bow.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Take a bow.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
If I get to work as a hero in the
movie directed by a director

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
who’s topped the box-office records...

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That’s why, this time, I want to do
an out-of-the box movie.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That’s a nice title.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Not the title. It’s
about the content.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Well, you are....

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Well, I came to audition
for your out-of-the-box movie.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You are very active.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I am going to use you.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Tell me, sir.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What’s the scene you want me
to audition for?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Come on... come on...
Tell me, sir. Tell me.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
The hero in our story is a rake.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
What’s going on?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Looks like your imagination is
leaping in bounds.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The set wouldn’t have a vegetable
stall or a food stall,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
samosa with chillies.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Why?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
No introductions and no
elevating the persona.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Well then, what about the
Hero character?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Do you remember Ali in that very
same movie Pokiri?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Remember he keeps begging?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He collects garbage in the streets
-No!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
In depth, he begging on
the temple steps

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Why?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I've already told you, right?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Out-of-the-box.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
When our hero is experiencing such
destitute and harrowing situation,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
a beautiful and glamorous
heroine enters his life.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
She is beautiful!

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It’s alright. Even though the hero’s
life is in a destitute state,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the heroine is
at least glamorous.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So, there is going to a
dream song and a duet.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There’s going to be
nothing of that sort.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Why, sir?
-Because she is already married.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Why would a married woman be
a central heroine of the story?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Out-of-the-box.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
What’s after this?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Interval block.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
kondareddy buruju

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Yes! The moment has arrived.
Now, it warms up.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
The hero is on one side...
-Yes, I am coming.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
On the other side, there is the
heroine and her husband.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I don’t care if he is beside her,
I’ll still come.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
20 goons at the center.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Stop it, sir.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
He's again going into his dreams...

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The crowning glory of
kondareddy buruju...

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Tracking shot

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I am throwing punches at
ten of the goons.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
No, you are not going to
throw any punches.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
How many times do I have to tell you
that it’s out-of-the-box?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
All the goons are going to surround
you and beat you up.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
They are going to throw you against
the stones,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
flip you over and throw
you down, push you....

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Your skull is going to explode and
you are going to turn mad!

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Stop it, sir!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You are Anil Ravipudi.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Instead of awards, I want songs,
fights, dance and comedy.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
He is very hurt.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Please make a movie where your
skills lie and what people like.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
There’s no portraying the hero as a
larger-than-life character,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
no introductions...

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Out of the box?!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Sir, this young man is going to
become a movie star for sure.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
You are right.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Arjun...

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
when are you going to
become a movie star?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
When are you going to
convince my father?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
When will we get married?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
There’s a lot of time, Subbu.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Don’t fret.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
No, Arjun.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
There’s isn’t any time left.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Why?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You are losing your hair.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
What?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Egg is very good to stop
one from balding.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
That’s true.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Good job.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Arjun, rub some lime juice.
It’s very good for your hair.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Excuse me?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
My dog is shedding a lot.
Is there any treatment available?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Humans don’t know how to
deal with

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
their own hair
and you ask for a dog?!

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Please stop.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You come in.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
There is a good new rap song
about hair fall.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Ball?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Isn’t this how we look when we
lose all our hair?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
There are warnings when we are about
to experience

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
earthquakes and Tsunamis.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Even then, can we stop them?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is exactly the same.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The only thing we can do is measure

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the damage by using the
Richter scale.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
What can we do?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
How long is it going to late?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It’s almost done.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
When the TV gets broken,
you get a new one.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Why would you
repair the old one?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You know about my dad, right?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Hello, brother?
Excuse me.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I am talking to you.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
If you could give us a minute of
your life,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
we will tell you something that will
change your life.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
What’s the biggest
problem in the world?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I won’t give you stupid answers
such as hunger or obesity.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The biggest problem in the world is
seeing

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
your well-grown hair fall off.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Is it true or not?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yes, it’s true!

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Yes!
-Yes!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Many of you might feel that
this isn’t such a silly problem.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
But brothers...

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You don’t just lose hair.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
You lose your confidence.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Do you agree or not?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Yes, that’s because when you lose
your hair,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
your
girlfriend leaves you

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and the wife that you got married to

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
because you like her,
will also leave you.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It’s embarrassing to take a photo

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and you would cry tears of
embarrassment to walk on the roads.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You would forever be tensed about

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
some school kids are going to mock
about your bald head.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Brother...

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
you might think that you are the
hero of your life.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But, have you ever seen a
hero who is bald?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
No! No! No!

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Do you want to get back the
hair that you’ve lost?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Yes, we do!
-Yes, we do!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Yes, we do!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Well, is there no solution
to this problem?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
The solution to this problem is
not in India, brother.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Shit!

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
But the solution to this problem
is available in China!

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Oh my goodness! In china?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Guys....Guys....

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
As soon as they mentioned China,
they ran away.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
The name of the product is Pistol.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We all know that crores of rupees
were spent

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
on making sure
you don’t lose hair.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We don’t want your crores, brother.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
We want only 999/- rupees only.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You said that it was a
China product.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But he looks Nepalese.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Do you think it will work?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Certainly.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
What is this?
-It’s a paper.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It’s a rap song –

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
You roll it, I’ll sing
and he will dance.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
After this song ends, no one can
stop you from being a hero.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
"The entire street and
the neighborhood."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
"Come on and have a look."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
"Brother has come...see the
place buzzing."

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
"We have to up the tempo."

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
"The entire district is
on a rhythm."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
"Flip up your collar and
begin your first step of dancing."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
"Come on, come on, give it up.
He is a very local guy."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
"With every step, bring in the
energy. He is the most special one."

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
"Come on, make some noise.
He is a very stylish fellow."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
"Come on, shade our brother
under an umbrella.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
He is full of energy."

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
"Come on, hit it! Hit it! Hit it!
Tear it apart!"

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
"Make sure that the tune is heard!
Hit it until it breaks down!"

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
"Cheers to Chiranjeevi who
impressed us with his moves."

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
"Cheers to Rajnikanth who
impressed us with his style."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
"For impressing us with his
emotional range, cheers to Venky!"

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
"For impressing us with his
performance, cheers to Balayya!"

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"I am going to bring the game on
When I hit the screens."

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
"I am going to bring you a basket
woven out of marigold flowers."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
"This is the beat.
It’s coming on, get ready."

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
"This is the beat.
Come on, hit it! Hit it! Hit it!"

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Who the hell was it?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Arjun.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
My father.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Who the hell was that?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Arjun...

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
My father.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You’ve been creating a ruckus.
Let’s go to the police station.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Come on, let’s go.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
You can explain yourself
in the station.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Why are you creating nuisance
on the roads

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with your movie shoots
and fights?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You idiot!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You said that you’ve taken
permission for the shoot.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Yes, I asked my dad
permission to do the shoot.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
How was I supposed to know you meant
permission from the police?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Brother, I’ll give you 500 bucks.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
How about 1000 bucks?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Keep quiet.
-How long do we have to wait?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Where is CI?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Urvasi?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Sir!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You got married, right?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Yes, sir.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
That is what I thought.
I thought you struck a good bargain.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Sit down. Sit down.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Put it inside.
-Okay, sir.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Did the wedding go well?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Yes, sir.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Then, what about your first night?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Sir, please.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
What’s up with him?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
He seems to be a sex sadist.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
You say please before your wedding
and even after your wedding.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Hello, excuse me?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Hey!

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Urvasi? Urvasi?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
He seems very twisted.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We need to deal with him carefully.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Namaste, sir.
-Namaste, sir.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
What’s going on with you?
-Rap, sir.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I am a rapper.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
File a report that he raped.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
No...no...Not rape, sir.
Rap.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
How do I explain this to you?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I sing songs, sir.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Isn’t the one who sings
called a singer?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
You must have gotten a job
through sports quota.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
This is the next level to singing,
sir.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Rap.
English, hip-hop.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I don’t think you would understand.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Why don’t you sing me a song?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Buddy, be quiet.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Would you let us go if I
sing you a song?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Thank you, sir.
ready, sir.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
One...two...three...check.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
When the (Dharmam) is going
off the track

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and the youth are going off
the rails,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Where are the police?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Where are they?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Where are they?
Where are they?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
When there is looting all around,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Where are the police
with their batons?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Where are they?
Where are they?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
We are here!
Here!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Do you think the police is a joke?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Are you crazy?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Sir...sir....why are
you hitting him?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
What’s going on?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Are you a rapper as well?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Hero.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Hero?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yes sir.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Is that why you are
dressed like this?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Sir, it’s a small issue.
Please let us go.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
They’ve been creating
nuisance in the public.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Calm down, uncle.
-Sir...

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
He is his uncle.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Uncle?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Did he marry his daughter to you?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Or did his daughter let
you pop her....?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Hit! Hit!

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Get the gun out! Get the gun out!
Oh goodness, it’s fallen down!

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Shoot him up!

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He ruined the lives of many women.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
He is a lusting monster

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Hello?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Yeah, came.
I’ll check.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Come on, guys.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
We will take care of him after
you become a hero.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Keep walking!

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
What is the reason for your
sudden visit, mom?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Mom, I am asking you.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Oh? You are talking to me?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I thought you were on the phone.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
What is going on?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
You do know about your father,
don’t you?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
He is very irritated about the
events that happened this morning.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Mother, what happened in the
morning was a shoot.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He didn’t know who you guys were.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
But, why did you come here without
any previous intimation?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Since your childhood,
have you ever seen me informing

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
you of everything before I do?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
That is not what I meant, father.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Nothing, dear.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Prasad uncle has started
a new project.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
He is adamant that I come
here and meet him.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I need to go to the US immediately.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
To the US?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
When are you leaving?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It’s not when are you leaving.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It’s – we are leaving.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
You are coming with us.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
What? Me? To the US?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So suddenly?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
The situation presented
itself in such a way.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
How would it look if you
stayed apart from us?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Dad, I need to tell you something.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It’s about your job, right?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
The best job in US at the
best hospital...

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and being married to a good guy
and into a respectable family.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Both are ready.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Dad, I am in love with someone.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Subbu...

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
have you gone crazy?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Do you know what you are
talking about?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
What do you mean you are in love?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Mother, please listen to me.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Who is the guy?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
The person who got into a
fight with dad...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Arjun.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Who would have predicted

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
what could happen at any minute?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Who would have predicted

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
what could happen at any minute?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Dad, please...

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Please listen to me once.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
What are you talking?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
What’s going on with
your appearance?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Your pants are torn and you look
like a homeless person.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Did you get chased by the dogs and
they tore your clothes?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Or did someone thrash you?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Dad, not now.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Dear, it seems I need an
appointment to reprimand him.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
You go.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You got a courier.
I put it in the room.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Courier?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Why would you say it like
it’s some award?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Order no. 1156...

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
7732

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Operator speaking in mandarin)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Where the hell are you, Man?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
That SI needs to be killed.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
We need to take his gun
and shoot him up.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
How dare he insults me?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Doesn’t he know who I am?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I have a small problem.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Where?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Something went wrong with
the courier.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Come to the terrace urgently!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Alright, come to the terrace.
I’m coming.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Brother...
-This vehicle is mine.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
...could you please drop me there?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Okay.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Please, Aishu.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
No.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Please, Aishu.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Hey, what is with this shameless
behavior on the terrace?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I learned this from you, brother.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
What is the matter?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Did you call the customer care?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
He said that it was the
correct order.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Then, it must be correct. The cap
must be somewhere... search for it.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Have you gone mad?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Why are you anxious?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Look at how the oil leaked out.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Buddy, that is blood.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
No, this is Navaratan oil.
It keeps you chilled.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The language spoken by the them
sounds the same

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but their thoughts
are completely different.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
They even gave a very unique
name to the virus.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Stop!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Ask her if she would like
to come to me?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
She looks like a college student,
sir.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
No...

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Looking at her,
I get the experience

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that she is a very
experienced professor.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
No, sir.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
What’s gotten into you?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Does it look like I am asking
you for your daughter?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Alright.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I will go to her.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
This is a real gun!

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
This company’s name is Pistole!
It’s a freaking design.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
It’s oil.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We ordered for oil and they
sent us a real gun!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You don’t believe it, right?
Let’s test.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Buddy... no... don’t...

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
No...

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Buddy, you are going to fire it!
-If you are scared, close your eyes.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I am going to close my eyes as well.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Please, listen to me.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Are you scared?
-Please, listen to me!

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
If that’s the case, I am going
to aim it towards me.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It’s a real gun!

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I am going to press the trigger.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
If I press the trigger, its
going to release oil.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Listen to me.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Put it on my head.
-It’s going to fire!

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Buddy, the oil....it’s slipping
away. Let go of the gun!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I am going to press it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Do you want to come with me?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Sir!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Sir!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Why did you fire it?
-Why did it fire?!

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Let’s get out of here.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Sir....

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Hold him.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
What happened? How did it fire?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
You were right.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It’s a real gun.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I kept telling you that it was a
real gun. Did you listen to me?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You said you were going to test!
Your stupid test!

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Hey, chill man.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
We found that it was a real gun
only after we tested it.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Come, let’s test it.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Come!

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I can understand your anger.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I am convinced.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
What do we do now?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Brother, courier.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Arjuna...

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Dad...

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Everyone in this world is
born and later dies.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
To change one’s life between
the events of birth and death...

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
...god provides a
single opportunity.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This isn’t a deal.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It is an opportunity given by
that Ravana Brahma.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Arjuna,
-Yes, dad.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Do you how the killing must
be carried out?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Even after your death, the manner in
which you killed

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
should continue to
be a topic of conversation.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Okay.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Open it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We don’t want crores of rupees,
brother.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We want just 999/- Rupees only.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
What is this?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Where is the gun?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
What is this?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is what the courier guy gave,
brother.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
That stupid.... You fool!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Dad...

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
don’t worry.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I will take care of it, father.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
What are you going to take care of?
What are you going to do?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
That is Bhai’s gun.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
If Bhai gives you a deal, it means
that the enemy must lose their life.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Or else, our lives are to be lost.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Go!

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Alright!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Go!

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
No matter who has the gun,
slice him up and get the gun back!

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Go!

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Guys, come on!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Do you think this is a good idea?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Definitely.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
What the hell is going on out here?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Investigation is going on, sir.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Investigation?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Your station CI was shot.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It’s not a civilian.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
If the media gets wind of this,
we are going to the laughing stock!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Sir!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Madam!

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Sir, please listen to us.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Madam, we need to tell you
something important.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Madam... please.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Shut up!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Why is it that no one is paying
attention

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
when my friend wants
to say something?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Is this police station or
railway station?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Hey!
-Tell now.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
What is it?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
What is your problem?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There is a problem with the system,
sir.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Please, keep quiet.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Sir...
-Tell me.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Well...

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Sir, I ordered a product online.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
But I didn’t receive the product.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Call the customer care number.
Why would you bring this to me?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Sir, don’t you ever
listen completely?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Hey!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
What’s with you?
-Sir...sir...sir...

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Please listen to me, sir.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
We didn’t receive the product that
we ordered for in the courier, sir.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
What did you get?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
How do we explain this to you?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Show me!

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Tell him that James Bond has it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Why are you hesitating?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
There was a murder attempt on the CI
right in the middle of the streets.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
When the CI who was strolling
the streets was shot,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
he fell down
in this position.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
That road looks familiar,
doesn’t it?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
What do you mean it looks familiar?
It’s the road of our street.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Our road?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Deeksha, there are suspicions that
the department has sought

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
vengeance and are behind
this incident.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
According to the
information we received...

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
it looks like this crime was
committed using an antique pistol.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
After this incident, the police have
come up with silly excuses such as

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
lack of petrol in the vehicles to
avoid patrolling the streets.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
The human rights organization are

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
infuriated with the
attitude of the police.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Don’t be nervous.
They are going to find out.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
You are the one who seems
to be shaking in.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Me?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Srikanth?
-Sir...

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
How did they find out this news?
First, switch off the TV.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Sir...
-What is the status of this case?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
We’ve sent the bullets to Mumbai for
forensic examination.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
We’ve alerted the check posts.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The culprit can’t have crossed
boundaries of the city, sir.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
If we find the gun, it’s as good as
catching the culprit.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
If you find out the culprit,
forget about catching him.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Just shoot him.
I’ll take care of the rest.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Okay, sir.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Keep it with you.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Why would you give it to me?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It’s yours, isn’t it?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You said that you
received a courier.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Shall we tell him the truth?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I am asking you. Are you going to
spill the truth or not?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I am not going to tell you, sir.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I’ve lost all faith in you, sir.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
When the CI was attacked right in
the middle of the streets,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
you couldn’t do anything, sir.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I can understand that you
have no information.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But when the CI was shot
at 10:00 last night,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
How could you have not
caught the criminal so far?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We didn’t know that he was
shot at 10:00 pm.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
How did you know that?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
People are talking about it
out there, sir.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
He’s written a song on it as well.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Me?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What song did you write?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Buddy, sing it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Police are useless.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
What the hell are you talking about?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
What is it that you want?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We want trust, sir.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Trust.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Until you find the culprit who is
responsible for shooting our CI,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I will never set foot in
this station, sir.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
You shouldn’t either.
Let’s go.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Let’s go.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Girls are very protective in the
presence of our CI

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
They are treated like
delicate flowers.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Yes, right.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Did he ever let girls walk
anywhere alone?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Our CI.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What now?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Is it the right time for you
to start singing?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We didn’t do anything else.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What do you want to do now?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Let’s throw the gun away.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yes!

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Yes!

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Dad...

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
What is it, dear?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Please meet with Arjun once again.
You will like him.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I won’t like him, dear.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
How can you say that you don’t
like him in one meeting?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
How can you assume that I would like
him if I meet him again?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Dad, Arjun is a very good person.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
If he a good man, ask him to
start a charity.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I will give him the money.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I won’t give him my daughter.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I really like Arjun a lot.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Isn’t this a good spot?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Buddy, the water here is very dirty.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Did we come here to have a bath?
We came here to throw the gun.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Okay.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I hope no one is watching us.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Buddy, it’s deep there.
Let’s throw it there.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The beauty spot of Hyderabad
is Hussain Sagar.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We’ve come to catch the people

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
who dirty the lake red-handed
in our Real News.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Do you know what they
are doing here?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
They are destroying
this green nature.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
When they say that our nation is in
the hands of the youth,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
is this what they meant?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
As soon as they see an open space,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
they open their pants to
reveal themselves.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Are they responsible for
the pollution?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Are they responsible for Corona?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We saw it in person.
You are watching it on LIVE.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We shall watch it again when the
telecast is repeated.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
One minute...One minute.
Did you see the gun?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Don’t you understand
anything directly?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Is the entire society going to
misunderstand everything?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Come!

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Is that the gun you meant?
-Why did you do that?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now, I am scared.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I want to pee.
Hold this.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
She hit me really hard.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
I need to go home immediately and
write a rap song on media.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Hello, Subbu.
-Where are you?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I am in a problem.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Father said that he would like
to meet you.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Come to the coffee
shop immediately.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I have some work.
I don’t think I can come, Subbu.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
You must come. That’s all.
-Fine, send me the location.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
What’s with this Subbu hassle?
-What can I do?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
She is asking us to come.
Let’s go.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Do you really need to meet the
bride at this time?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
What do you mean meet the bride?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Is he going to come or
should we keep waiting?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
He is already here, father.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Sorry, uncle.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
That day I was tensed and
spoke out of turn...

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Who amongst the both of you
is in love with my daughter?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Oh goodness!

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I am not the one, uncle.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I didn’t pay a lot of
attention to your daughter.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
If I did, you would have already
married your daughter to me.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Go away.
Get out of here.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Sorry, uncle.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
He is just a little too
enthusiastic.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Thank you for considering me as a
potential groom for your daughter.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Bag...

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Go out.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
He is just jealous.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Sorry, uncle.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I was worried about my hair fall...

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and also because the expected
courier did not arrive.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And suddenly, you being there made
me even more nervous.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
With all that’s going on...

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Hey, thanks, uncle.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Arjun.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
What are you doing?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
How do you smoke this?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I just accepted it because it would
be impolite to refuse.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But I don’t smoke.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
My daughter told me
everything about you.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
You told him everything already?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Foolish of me to have wasted 18
rupees unnecessarily.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
She didn’t tell me about
the cigarettes.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
She told me about your interest in
the movie industry.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
This is to prep for a movie.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
A lot of people who wanted to
become big movie stars ended up

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
ruining their lives.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
All those who’ve tried must have
ruined their lives.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Those who are unwavering in their
focus must have surely

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
become movie stars.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Do you think it’s easy to
become a movie star?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
My friends said the very same thing,
uncle...

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
.... about your daughter.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But she fell for me.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I took her for drives on my bike
and even kissed her.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Hey, when did I kiss you?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
She didn’t kiss me.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Father, he is lying to you.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I didn’t kiss him.
I didn’t kiss him.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
She didn’t kiss me.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Excuse me?
Water.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Dad...

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Sorry!

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Does my daughter mean as much
to you as you becoming a movie star?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I feel the same way about
both of them, uncle.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Just like alcohol, cigarettes and drugs,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
obsessing over becoming a
movie star is an addiction as well.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Will you let go of your dreams of
becoming a movie star

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and come with
us by choosing my daughter?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Please listen to me...

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I didn’t come here to listen to
your explanations.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Do you want my daughter or
do you want to pursue your dreams?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Subbu...
Do you want me or your father?!

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
If I said something like that it
sounds really foolish,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
doesn’t it,sir?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Sir, please try to understand...
I am in worst situation

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I’ll be back later.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Arjun!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Move!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
How much is this?
-100 rupees.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Hey, where you coming to, you...?!

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Oh! My bag.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Hey, my phone!

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Catch him! Catch him!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I got him!

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Stop!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Don’t hold tightly.
-Alright, fine.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Slowly... careful

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh no, Cops!

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Sir...sir...please let me go.
-Bag sir.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Sir...sir...please let me go.
I beg you.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Is that bag yours?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We need to check your bag, don’t we?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
He is opening the bag.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
What is in the bag?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Sir...sir...sir...

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
There is nothing in the bag.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Don’t open the bag, sir.
-Sir...sir...sir, please.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Don’t open it, sir.
-Please, sir.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Don’t .... Don’t ...Don’t...
-Sir...sir...sir...

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Subbu...

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Bag?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
The bag is with Subbu.
It’s got mixed up with hers.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Damn!

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Subbu?
-What is it?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Where is the bag?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
It’s with me.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Where are you?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I am going to attend a
party at GR gardens.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Really?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I need to meet with you right now,
Subbu.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
It’s not possible.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Buddy, we won’t find the mirror...
-Let’s go!

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Our folks are inside.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Let’s go.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Do we really need to adhere
to the dress code?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
How am I?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000

She says she is
scared of ghosts."

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
"There is a young girl in my village.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
She says she is
scared of ghosts."

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
"There is a young fellow in
that very village."

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
"He asked her not to be afraid
since he was around "

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
"Come on play, play, play.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
A delicate jasmine bud, a
delicate jasmine bud,"

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
"Come on play, play, play. A
delicate jasmine bud,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
a delicate jasmine bud,"

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
"Hey, cheers! Cheers! Cheers!"

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
"There is a young girl in my
village.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
She says she is

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
"There was a young fellow in

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
"He asked her not to be afraid
since he was around "

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Brother, we found out
where he lives.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
He lives in Ameerpet.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Shall we go?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
What? Do you think you can dance to
the tunes of our superstar Krishna?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
If that’s the case,
dance to this tune.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
DJ!

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
This song is dedicated to
all superstar fans.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
"Oh dear young girl, you are a
sculpture of Ellora."

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
"You are one who breaks
young men’s hearts."

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
"I am going to entice you with
my new dance moves."

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
"Even Micheal Jackson is going
to be impressed."

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
"Oh dear young girl, you are a
sculpture of Ellora."

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
"You are one who breaks
young men’s hearts."

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
"I am going to entice you with
my new dance moves."

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
"Even Micheal Jackson is going
to be impressed."

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Hey!

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Dear!

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Dear!

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Dad...

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Sir!

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Sir, this bullet was found in the
ATS commissioner’s body.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
This bullet was found when a CI was
attacked in Hyderabad.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Both are a matched, sir.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Are you sure?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I am sure, sir.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
The bullet has been fired from
Marilyn model gun, sir.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
The gun belongs to Salim Bhai, sir.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
If the gun is in Hyderabad...

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
He must be in Hyderabad.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Bhai, the gun and the target’s photo
have reached Hyderabad.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Before Bhai wakes up, he
should be dead.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Hello?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Mother, where are the keys?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
They must be in the cupboard beside
the door. Look there.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Alright.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You got another courier.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Courier?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Where did you put it?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
It’s right there in the hall.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Brother, this side.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Brother, the courier is for me.
The gun is mine as well.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Pack up!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
What happened?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
You presented yourself as a big deal
and you have nothing to show for it?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Did you use the gun?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
There should have been five.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Who are you, sir?
Why do you want to kill me?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Who are these...

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I don’t work at customer service
to provide you with confirmation.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I need to finish this quickly.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
I am hungry.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
You are so lucky.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You are dying for Salim Bhai.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Sir, who is Salim Bhai?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Does the movie have any logic in it?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Movies don’t usually have any logic.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
You and your son are...

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
If you want science and logic,
head to the library...

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Who are all these people?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I am asking you.
Who are these people?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Sir, please.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Savior...He is my savior.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Thank you, brother. Thank you.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Bless me, mother.
Father, you too.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Mother, your prayers have worked.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Your curses have turned into boons.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
The day that I’ve been waiting for,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
for the past 25 years is
finally here, mother.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Please, sir.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
If grandfather was alive today....

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
He would have died watching your
over-the-board performance.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Tell us what’s going on.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I’ve been cast as a hero, mother.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
The opportunity that I have waited
for all these days came

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and landed
directly at my doorstep.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I don’t believe you.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I know that, father.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
That is why I am
explaining it mom here.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Who are all these people?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Team...this is our team.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Team? I don’t believe you.
It looks like a gang.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Who is he?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
My director.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
What about this one in a
flowery shirt?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Cinematographer.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
What about this one with
disheveled hair?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Fight master.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Who the hell is he?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Producer.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
How is he the producer?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Gosh, why would you be so
disrespectful towards the producer?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Sorry, sir.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Mother, don’t do it.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Hold on.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Director, is my son truly the
hero in your movie?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Such a wonderful news!

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
There are no sweets at home to
celebrate this moment.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Would you like to have some biryani?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Serve them.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
A little more?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Please sir.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Are you just going to be happy
that your son’s become the hero?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Aren’t you curious about the story?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
It’s his first movie.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Son, did you listen to the story?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
How is it?
Tell me...tell me...tell me...

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
How can I narrate the story now?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I’ll explain it later.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Why bother asking you?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Director sir, please
tell me the story.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000

Could you please stop that
background music

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
and narrate the story?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Father, creative people don’t keep
narrating stories

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
as and when demanded.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
They can keep eating biryani
whenever they want.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
But they narrate the story in a
particular time only?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Producer sir?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Have they at least narrated
the story to you?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Stop it, father.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
What are you talking?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
The story is the first
hero of the script.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
You must narrate the story.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
You want the story?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Please tell us.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Fine, I’ll tell you.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
You sit down.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Thanks!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Madam, please sit down.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
The story begins with the
opening scene of Mumbai.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
The city is ridden with smuggling,
drugs, extortion.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
All these things are run
by Salim Bhai.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
He is.... he is a big...

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Kollagaran (Gangster)

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
What’s the word for it?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Gangster.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Gangster.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The number of murders
committed by Bhai are....

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
...countless.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
When Bhai makes a strategy,
he doesn’t miss the target.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
If that is your favorite,
this is my favorite.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Don’t throw it.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
You know about Savyasachi
(ambidextrous), right?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Even my enemy gets two
options from me.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Do you want to die by a
cigarette or by a gun?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
No matter where my enemy is or
how far they go...

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I chase them relentlessly
and kill them.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Salim Bhai gave Arjun a contract to
carry out a killing.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
To carry out the killing,
he sent a gun

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and the photo of the
target through courier.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
That courier doesn’t
reach that Arjun.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Instead, it reaches this Arjun.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Arjun knows the entire story.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Now, tell me, sir.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
What do I do now?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Kill him.
-Father!

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yes, It’s the most
logical thing to do.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
What if he takes pity and files a
complaint at the police station...

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
He needs to be killed.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I went to kill him.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
But his mother intervened.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Just like this mother
here who fed me.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I gave him a chance
because of his mother.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It’s ruined.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
The cinema is going to be ruined.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Where is the logic in it, sir?

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Since the protagonist isn’t as
educated as me,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I doubt the
emotional connection would work.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
He is a road-side goon.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Street-side goon.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
He is a blob of cow dung
fallen on the road.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Cow dung! Cow dung!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Forget it! Forget it! Forget it!

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Consider everything that has
happened

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
to be a nightmare
and just forget about it.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You have a good family.
be happy.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
But I must warn you.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I am not just leaving you here
with your life intact.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
I am leaving because I believe you.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
If this gets out, I am going to kill
everyone in your family.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Sir!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Following this is an interval block.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Does the logic seem right to you?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I shall take my leave.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Madam, I shall take my leave.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Come on.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Young brother.
-Sir!

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Give me that cover.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Director sir...

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
please cast a beautiful
heroine beside my son.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Is that all?
I shall see to that.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
As long as your mother is with you,
nothing is going to happen to you.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I shall be back.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Where are you off to?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
To the heroine.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Grandma, where is Subbu?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
They are all in the hospital.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Hospital?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Doctor, I hope nothing is
going to happen to him.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Yeah, his condition is stable now.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Do not bear any news that is going
to make him worried and anxious.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Okay?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Subbu...

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Subbu...

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Go away from here.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Subbu, listen to me.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Just listen to me for two minutes.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
No, I won’t listen.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Someone is trying to
kill your father.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I know it.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
You know it?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Yes!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
You only...

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
you are trying to kill my father.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
What happened, Subbu?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
My father did not like you.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
You stressed my father out and
caused him to have a heart attack.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
You believed that this would
lead me to marry you.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
That’s your plan, right?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Have you gone crazy?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Someone is out to kill your father.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Let’s tell your father this and find
out what exactly happened?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Who would want to kill my father?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Narrate all your stories
to some producer.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Don’t tell me.
-Subbu.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Get out.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Subbu, please.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Get out!

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Young brother.
-Sir.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Give me that cover.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Brother, I know him.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Urvasi...

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Come.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Were you waiting for me to wake up?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Doctor!

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Doctor!
-Yes!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
What happened to me, doctor?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
The bullet directly hit
your spinal cord...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Hit my spinal cord and...

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
It didn’t kill you but it completely
shattered your ability to procreate.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Yes!

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You can no longer have sex.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Doctor....
Please do something, doctor.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Doctor!
-I already told you, didn’t I?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Nothing is going to happen.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Man! Lift it, lift your head up.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I got this rocket to make you proud.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
If you have sugar or high blood
pressure, or ulcer or even cancer...

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Even if you have Aids...

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
You would confess it to your
girlfriend or your wife.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
But, if you have this problem,
you can never confess it to anyone.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
That is why I present to
you this Rocket.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
When you consume Rocket,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
you can carry on the deed anywhere
without being exhausted

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
and take it however far you want to.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
The special thing about this Rocket

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
is that you can use it to
satisfy two women...

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
three women and if you prefer,
even four women.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
If you take on more than that,
your libido might fail.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.000
And that’s not our responsibility
because conditions apply.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
With this Rocket,
you are going to nudge

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
your sleeping libido into action.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Is the shot okay?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Hey, woman.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Who are you?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Enough.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
You told me that you got me the
costume worn by Varun Tej in

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
that movie Antariksham.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Do you know how short it is?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
And you say that Varun Tej wore it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
You are all good at
spinning stories.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Who are you guys?

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Trump!

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Where is he?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
What's happening?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Pooja Hegde?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Rashmika Mandanna?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Who are you guys?
Why did you kidnap me?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Friends.
You missed the high-five.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Hold on a minute.
-(together) Friends.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Why do I care if you are
friends or family?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Why did you kidnap me?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Well, why did we kidnap him?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Just as product with out promotion,
you are trying to extract

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
revenge without a reason.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
When a friend gives a party,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
don’t all the friends join in to
drink and celebrate?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Just because you can run your mouth,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
don’t throw in bad
jokes into the mix.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Your reason is absurd.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Nothing, brother.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Our Tata Sky isn’t working.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
We kidnapped you so that
you can repair it.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Yeah, right. Like this is
Anthariksham movie

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
and I am Sai Dharam Tej.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
But it’s Varun Tej in the movie
Anthariksham, right?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
You are offended, aren’t you?
I am in the same situation too.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Tell me what’s the reason.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You want a reason, right?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Our hero is going to enter soon.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Is he the one?
-Yup.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
He is always like this.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
That door bounces off the hinges,
brother.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I hope you are not hurt.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Give him the reason.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
The reason is...

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Pistol!

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
You received the courier for the
second time.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
That must mean you
got the oil for sure.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
No.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
My father-in-law’s photo came in it.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Who wants to kill your
father-in-law?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
How did your father-in-law
get on his radar?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
There is some connection between
your father-in-law arriving

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
so suddenly from out of town...

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and trying to take Subbu to
the US in a hurry.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Yes!

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Your father came to
Hyderabad on the 7th.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
The attack on Salim Bhai
happened on the 5th.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
That means that your father-in-law
is somehow connected to that attack.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Yes!

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I figured it out.
His father-in-law is a gangster.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Bhasha! Bhasha!

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Dear, what happened?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
The doctor advised you to
stay in the bed.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Nothing happened to him.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Sir!

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
As you instructed, I lied
to your daughter.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Lie?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Is your heart attack a lie?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Nothing happened to you?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Do you know tensed your
daughter was?

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Okay, sir.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
I did all this to shock
her a little.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
That is when she would be convinced
to come to the US with us.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
But, Subbu and Arjun are in love.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Shhh!

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
This is how it’s supposed to happen,
Lakshmi.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
It would be better for everyone if
things happen this way.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I am as good as dead if you disclose

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
anything about this until we
board the flight.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Now, I am going to wait and
see the drama unfold.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Who is my father-in-law?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
What did he do in Mumbai?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I need to find all the details.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
How are you going to do that?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Follow.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
"This is over-dramatic!"

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Is everything okay?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
All the reports are clear?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Everything is alright!

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Careful!

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
"Let's hear this story"

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Play entrance camera.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
"The Movie titles has begun"

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
"Started the hunt between
hero and

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
villains like a sherlock
homes story"

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
There he is.
Bhasha.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Look at his style!

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Hey! You keep quiet

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Stop your nonsensical talk.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
"My girl's father is a villain
the movie genre mafia thriller"

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
"I wonder that you are a
Don or troubler"

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
"My love story has end up
with your entry"

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
He is changing his appearance.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Look at how your father-in-law is
transforming himself into a Don.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
What??

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
He is getting someone ready just
like him. Like Saddam Hussein.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
"Let's hear this story"

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I am going to get all your reports,
sir. Please don’t hurt me.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Go and get it.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Okay, sir.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
He gave him a warning.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Didn’t I tell you?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
This is exactly like the scene
from the movie Bhasha.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
He is a gangster!

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Don’t be disrespectful.
-Disrespectful?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
He is my father-in-law.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Father-in-law? Yeah, right!
He is a bloody gangster!

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Oh, dear! He’s come.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
How many times do I have to tell you
not to eat everything you find?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Saidhulu, come here.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
All the sharpshooters and career
criminals in our list

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
must be present here immediately.
Go!

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Tell me who made that shot?
-I didn’t do it, sir.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Tell me!
Tell me who made that shot?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
We are not some small alleyway
thugs to shoot people

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
without taking account of the
place or the location.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
We are professional shooters.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
His cerebral functions
are improving.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Heart pulses are come down.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Leave all that. When is our
brother going to wake up?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Don’t ask me.
Ask God.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Where is he?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Where?
-Who are you talking about?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Serve me a piece of meat.
-This is a vegetarian dish.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Veg?!

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Where is he?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Tell!
-I don't know.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Subbu, listen to me once.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
In a week’s time, my family and I
are going to the US.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I will no longer be
present in your life.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I’ll never let you go anywhere.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
"What is all the suspense"

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
"Tell the climax quickly"

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
"This story horror genre or killer"

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
"Let's end the story"

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
(Rap)

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Play the CCTV footage.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I want the CCTV footage of
this apartment.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
(Rap)

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
"This is over-dramatic!"

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Mom... what was father
doing in Bombay?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000
"This is over-dramatic!"

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Dear!
-Mom is calling.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Coming.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
"This is over-dramatic!"

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
"Let's hear the story"

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
"Hey Rama! Hey Rama!"

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
"This is over-dramatic!"

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
What is it, Dad?
-Did anyone come here?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
In the room?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I put my phone somewhere...
-Hall...it’s in the hall.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Why do you look down?

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Is there a problem?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Nothing, father.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
I am your father.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
You can share anything with me.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
What happened, father?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Don’t try to hide it anymore.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I know everything.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Your movie’s been stalled, right?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Movie?
No.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Why do you have such a doubt?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Anyone who looks at them is bound
to have such doubts.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Brother, please... please...

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Why did they come here?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Nothing, brother.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
While I was passing by this side...

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
The smell of your mother’s
biryani wafted

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
all the way to the
end of the street.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And also...

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Even the dogs in our area don’t
smell things this aggressively.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Dear, apparently the director wanted
to start casting

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
but he couldn’t
find the person in that photo.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
How will he find him when
we kidnapped him?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
What did you say?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I didn’t say anything.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
You said something.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
You said that you kidnapped someone.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I mean...

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Since you can’t find the person in
the photograph,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I was wondering if
he was kidnapped...

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Just as he suggested, what if he was
really kidnapped by someone?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Yes, brother! Correct!

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Shut up, you fool!

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
If he is found, he would be killed
instead of being kidnapped.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
If you are here, who is going
to kill him, sir?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
The second one.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
What? A second one?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
You mean there are two
heroes in the movie?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
It wouldn’t be nice to put him in a
multi-starrer in his very first movie.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Mom, please stop.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
This isn’t about hero.
There are two villains.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Oh!

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
The order came from Salim Bhai.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Two houses, two wives,
two similar cars

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
and two similar looking
guns came here.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
One gun came here.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
The second gun...

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Who could he have given it to?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
That’s what I don’t know.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Check the vehicle.
-Hey, stop! Stop!

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Hey, open the door!

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
What’s inside?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Constables, let the vehicle go.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Okay, sir.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000
move

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
The one who agreed to the deal.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
No one knows when
he would come

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
and how he would make an
appearance either.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
But,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
But he will definitely come to kill.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Where is he?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Tell me

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
What are you doing here?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Nothing, father.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
I am asking you.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I told you that it’s nothing.
Don’t you get it?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
What the hell is happening here?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Why are they trying to kill him?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
We’ve donned on different disguises
to find out the reason

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
but nothing
is working out so far.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
How about we go to the police?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Well, they would first arrest me on
the charge of shooting a CI.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Or if I confess that my
father-in-law is a don,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
he is going
to kill the both of us.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Me too?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Instead of working on your auditions

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
why did you get yourself
involved in this?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Hero isn’t someone who is just
on screen, father.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
If need be, one has to stand up and
fight in real life too.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Please stop the sermon and
tell me what needs to be done.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Where are they?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
We are going to be leaving to the US
in another four days.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Why bother going to the
temples and praying?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Until I tell you, none of you should
get down from the car.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Welcome to the Rampa
Choduvanu evil forest.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Cars cannot penetrate
this thick forest.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And there are no cheer girls to be
found in this little forest.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
There is no signal here.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And if you are hit, there’s no one
around to question either.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Do you have gold,
mobile phone or cash,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
or do you have a desire to live?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Do you have the gun?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Gaja!

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Gaja.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Powerful than a gun.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Hey man, I am going to give you a
mind-blowing offer.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Place your sword on my neck.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Why?
-You would get one crore rupees.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
You mean money I can count?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Apart from the list that you’ve
asked earlier,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
ask for my
father-in-law’s suitcase as well.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
The money is in it?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
I am going to cut his throat.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
If you don’t pay me one crore,
I am going to kill him.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I am going to kill him.
-Arjun!

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Arjun!
Arjun!

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
If you don’t pay me one crore,
I am going to kill him.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I want my one crore rupees.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I am going to kill him.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Apart from the list I’ve given
you earlier,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
give me your
suitcase as well.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I am going to kill him.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
I am going to kill him.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Young man...look here.
-Don’t hurt him.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
I will give you all the
gold that I own.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
He’s been cast as a hero in a movie.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Please let my son go.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Gold?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Remember the one crore rupees,
idiot!

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I don’t care about the gold.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
You should open that door, come out
of it and give me the suitcase.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
If not, I am going to kill him.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I am going to kill him.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
I am going to kill him.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
When the danger is here,
why are you busy discussing there?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
If there is a mosquito in the house,
you should kill it with a bat.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Not a bullet, sir.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Bloody fool!

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Do you know whose path
you’ve obstructed?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Do you know who you are
demanding money from?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
You didn’t just stop the car.
You stopped your death.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
If you see an elephant in the
forest, you should stop right there.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
If you see a lion, you
should run away.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Boss!

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000
It’s time to offer a
sacrifice to the goddess.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I don’t understand what
you’re saying, sir.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Make it more impactful!

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Don’t kill him.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Subbu...
Stop it!

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Listen to me.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I am going to kill him.... Subbu,
stop.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Subbu, don’t go.
-I am going to kill him.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Blood!

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Blood! Blood!

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Blood!

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I am going to kill him!

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Please don’t kill him.
He is the only son I have.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Father, give him the suitcase.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
I am going to kill him!

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I am going to kill him!

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Give me a crore or else I am
going to kill him!

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Let him go.
-I am going to spill his blood.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Blood! Blood!

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
If you don’t come, I am
going to kill him.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I am going to kill him.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I am going to kill him.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Why are you slow? Hurry up!

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I am going to cut his
neck right now.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Police! Police!

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Goodness, escape!
Run away! Run away!

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
It’s an ambulance.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Brother...

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Brother...

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Someone please take me.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
You are blind.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
How you’ve fooled us!
You prick!

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
It looks like the tyre
has a puncture.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
We are heading to Rajahmundry as
well. You can come in our car.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Please...

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Please... Please...

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
"Don’t be upset, darling.
It’s messing with my head."

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
"Don’t mess me up, darling.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Don’t twist that tiny waist of
yours around."

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
"When you are angry, your beauty is

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
magnified a thousand-fold."

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
"You are messing up my mind,
when you keep following me around."

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
"You are messing with my mind,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
when you keep touching me
here and there.."

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
"A girl’s anger is as powerful
as RDX explosives."

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
"If you get any close, you are going
to be blown to bits."

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
"Won’t my youth spring up
and take notice

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
When I see such
sweet lips of yours?"

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
"I am not the one who falls
for such sweet talk.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
You and I are not
right for each other."

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
"Why do we need to fight,
my baby hooligan?"

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
"Don’t look at me like you are
out for revenge."

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
"I am not easily moved by
such latest talk."

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
"Even if you praise me, I
won’t fall for it."

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
"You are my golden beauty.
Why would you say that?"

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
"If you walk away, what am I to do?"

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
"I already told you, didn’t I?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Let’s end this business of
love between us."

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
"Go away if you
want...take another path."

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
"Shower me with your smile again,
dear."

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
"I have kept the window of my
heart open for you."

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
"Don’t keep irritating me
every hour of the day."

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
"If I tell my dad, he is going to
give you a stern warning."

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
"When you keep twirling your tiny waist around,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
How can I stay put?"

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
"I’ve been patient and I
keep telling you."

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
"But, why won’t you listen?
Are you drunk?"

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
"Even if I have my drink without
a drop of water.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
No one can make me
as high as you do."

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
"Oh my god, what’s with
this nonsense?"

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
"Just because you ask me to let it
go, do you think I would melt?"

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
"Don’t be upset, darling.
It’s messing with my head."

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
"Don’t mess me up, darling.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Don’t twist that tiny waist of
yours around."

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
"When you are angry, your beauty is

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
magnified a thousand-fold."

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
"You are messing up my mind,
when you keep following me around."

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
"You are messing with my mind,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
when you keep touching me
here and there.."

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
"A girl’s anger is as powerful
as RDX explosives."

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
"If you get any close, you are going
to be blown to bits."

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Sir!

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Rewind...

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Stop!

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Open the door.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Hold on, I am opening it.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Hurry up and pack.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Go and pack the things!
Go and pack!

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Let’s run away.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Food is very tasty.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
They were hungry.
That is why I ordered a pizza.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Take a video of this.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
My father needs to watch
this fellow die.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Sir, I’ll give you another pizza,
please let him go.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
I’ll feed you another pizza,
please let my husband go.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Forget about pizza, he
is killing me!

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Shut up!
Watch your death!

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Hey, not me.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
You idiot!

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I am not the one who
needs to be killed.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
If you got the courier the second time,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
it must mean that you
received the oil.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
No, my father-in-law’s
photo came in it.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Brother, I can’t take this anymore.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I am going to tear his limbs,
cut his throat up and take his life.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Shut up!

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
He fooled me!

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Yes, he did the same!
Do you understand?

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
We are going to be leaving to the US
in another four days.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Why bother going to the
temples and praying?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
You and your foolish beliefs!

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
I will get it.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Search for him.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Give me a coconut.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Give me some vermillion as well.
-For me as well.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Alright.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Don’t think my father will be
convinced with you

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
following us around.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Who came here to convince your
father? I came here to save him.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Won’t you change?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
I am unable to believe
that you are

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000
praying for the success
of his movie.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
When there are unbelievable things
that are happening in our life...

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
we must believe them, Sharada.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Pray.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Subbu.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Your father is in real danger.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Give me the coconut.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Did you see him anywhere?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Do you know him?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Hey, I saw him.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Come.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Here. Right here.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Arjun!
-There. Right there!

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Do you know what you’re doing?
-I saw him right here.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Show us where he is.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Arjun! I am talking to you.
Stop it!

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Why did you stop?
-Arjun, listen to me.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Do you know what you’re doing?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Keep going.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Arjun...

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Sir...Sir...
Please, sir.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
We don’t know anything.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Let us go, sir.
Please, sir.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Sir...sir...sir...

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Buddy, he asked me about your
father-in-law and got me here.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
That’s a gun.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
If you are here, who is going
to kill him, sir.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
The second guy.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Put it inside.
-Okay, sir.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Deal?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Sir, when you were in the hospital,
you got this courier.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Father, who are you?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
What were you doing in Mumbai?

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Why do so many people
want to kill you?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Why has mom undertaken a
vow of silence?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Why did you come from Mumbai?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Why are we going to the US?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Tell me, father.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Father, I am asking you.
Tell me.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Why are you leaving
without answering me?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Tell me, dad.
-I’ll tell you.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Tell me what is your plan?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Speak out!

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Tell me what is your plan?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Bhai...
Bhai...

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Bhai, please forgive me.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Forgive you?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
I am not a God to forgive you.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I am the Khaitan!
The Khaitan!

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Cut! Cut! Cut!

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Why?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
When you say Khaitan, it’s the name
of brand of electric fans.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
When you say Saithan,
it means a Don.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Sir...Sir...Sir...
Sorry, sir.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
One more, sir.
Please, sir.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
You mean...

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
He is not a Don?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
I.... apparently, he is not a Don.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
No, he isn’t.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
He is a government employee.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
He works five days a week.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
But on the weekends,
he strived hard

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
to improve and use his
acting skills.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
You colored your mustache as
well as your hair.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Did you color your face as well?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
At some point in their lives, people
generally give up their bad habits.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
But,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
He wanted to be cast and picked up
those bad habits in his fifties.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Apart from consuming alcohol and
smoking, he also risked his life.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Do you know what he did?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
What did he do, aunty?

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
At your age, why do you need
to work so hard?

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Why would you say that, Laxmi?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
If tomorrow, I get cast in a movie
like Swathi Mutyam,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
I need to do
justice to the character.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Looking your dedication about films,
I felt...

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Biopic director.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Direc...

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Director sir.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
If I show you Salim Bhai,
would you be able to act like him?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
I will do it, sir.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
If you convince him, the
role is yours.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I’ll send you the location,
come right away.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Yes, sir.
I’ll come right away.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
That was the time when the police

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
were waiting for an opportunity
to capture Salim Bhai.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
What is the situation?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Sir is in a very bad mood.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Sir!

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Any leads?
-No, sir.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Khaleel escaped.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Shit, man!

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
We are trying our best, sir.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
According to the latest information
we received,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Salim is going to be here in India for the
next fifteen days.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
At any cost, we must catch him
within these fifteen days.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
I want to shoot him point blank.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Salim...Savyasachi?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Sir!

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
There were a lot of Dons who came
appeared in Mumbai

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
and disappeared too.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
But to live even after death...

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
you need to have a movie
made about your life.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Bhai, the director is here.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Bring him in.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Salam-alaikum, Bhai.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Ah, director.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Did you find a hero?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Yes, sir. We found a hero.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Sir, it’s me.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Stop the music.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
You are the hero?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
He is going to be
starring in my biopic?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Come here.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Do you know who I am?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
When I was 9 years old,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I murdered someone for a rolled
tobacco cigarette.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
After that, I relentlessly killed
all those clever and crafty people

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
who came in my way.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
There are at least 100
chargesheets filed against me.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
And even then, the police
couldn’t do anything.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
You are going to be playing
me in my biopic?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Salim Bhai’s biopic?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Fat man!

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Who do you want?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Sharukh Khan, Salman Khan or the
good-looking Hrithik,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
no matter who it is.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Just talk to them, I am going
to lock their dates.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
And you got him, you fool?!

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
To play Salim Bhai?

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Get lost!

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
If you don’t, I will cut you up.
Get out! Out! Out!

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Sir...
-Get out!

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
What did you say?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
You must have started killing when
you were 9,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I started
acting since I was 6.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And right from then, I’m still
struggling to be cast as a hero.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
When I was gaining weight
around my tummy,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I went to the gym
early in the morning.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I begged assistant directors for
opportunities.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I took Managers out for drinks.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
I paid casting directors cash to
get casted in movies.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
And I kept wishing everyone
connected with the industry,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
on their WhatsApp.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I even colored my hair
because it turned white.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
And when I lost my hair,
I put on a wig.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Sharukh Khan? Aamir Khan?
Salman Khan?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Sharukh Khan will act
like Sharukh Khan.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Aamir Khan will act like Aamir Khan.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Salman Khan will act
like Salman Khan.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
But the one who will act like
Salim Bhai is me.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Me!

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Even after you die, I am the only
one who can make people believe

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
that you are alive with my acting skills.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
It’s me! It’s me! It’s me only!

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Lion!

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Lion!

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
We found a hero!

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Munna, look at him.
What an actor!

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Look at his performance!

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Pick out an auspicious time.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I will come at that time and
start the clap...

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
...and what is it that they say?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Sound and action.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
(Chanting prayers)

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Shall I call Subbu and tell her?
-No! No!

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
After it releases in the theatre,
I’ll take her and surprise her.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Okay?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Okay.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Mom, dad wanted to keep this a
secret so that he could surprise me?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Is that important?
Is that important now?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Can’t you understand the
situation we are in now?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Aunty, you sent uncle
off with prayers.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Salim Bhai is waiting for his
biopic to be released.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
The police are waiting to
nab Salim Bhai.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Aunty, by some misfortune,
did uncle kill Salim Bhai?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Please tell us, aunty.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
My head is splitting.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Tell us, aunty.
What happened?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
His engine failed.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Oh my god!

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
It's getting late!

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Let's ask for lift.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Sir...sir...
One minute.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Sir, I am getting late for an
opening. Could you please drop me?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Where do you want to go?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Just around here, sir.
Lal stadium.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Lal stadium?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Earlier, you said that there was an
opening. -The opening for a movie.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Are you an actor?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Who is the hero in the movie?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
It’s me, sir.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Hero at your age?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Hello?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Do you know Salim Bhai’s age?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
What?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
What happened?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
As soon as I mentioned Salim Bhai,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
you sound as frightened as
the Mumbai police.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Don’t be scared, sir.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I am the hero in Salim
Bhai’s biopic.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Shall I tell you a secret?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Even Salim Bhai is coming
for the opening.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
What? You don’t believe me.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Here is a selfie of me
with Salim Bhai.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Mr. Hero?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Can I have a selfie with you?
-Yes, sure.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
That’s it.
Thank you.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Welcome!

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Mr. Hero?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
can I come for the opening as well?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Yes, come along.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
But, don’t disturb anyone there.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
I won’t disturb at all.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Let’s go then. We are getting late.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Bhai...

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Oh my god!

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Bhai.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Bhai, let’s go.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
We will deal with them later.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I will not leave those
scoundrels alone!

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Salim Bhai...

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Come...
Come, come.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
....I am going to kill you.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Even when the police said that they
would protect us

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
if we stayed with them,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
he burned all over past

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
and we came to start a new life
with our daughter.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
You!

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Don’t stop me.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Give me a cigarette.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Uncle you don't smoke, right?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
People will die after listening to
such a horrid backstory.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
If they don’t smoke, they
are going to die.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Give it to me.
-Here it is.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
A lot of people who wanted to be in
the movie industry ruined their lives.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Uncle, please listen to me once.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Who gave it to you?

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Uncle, please.
-A Don and a horrid flashback!

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
It’s not that, uncle.
There is a Don in the story, right?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I can’t take it.
-Subbu, your dad’s letter.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
You can’t swim.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
It’s useless to live any longer.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Subbu!

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I dreamed like everyone else.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I’ve been trying hard to
fulfill those dreams.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
When I wanted to leave everything
and give it my full attention,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
my parents got me married.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
When you were born,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
I had to set aside my dreams to take
on the responsibility of you.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
When I fulfilled all my responsibilities
and pursued my dreams again.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
my talent led to an opportunity but
luck did not favor me.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Subbu, one need both talent
and luck for success.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
That day, I spoke to Arjun in a
discouraging manner.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
It doesn’t matter if our dreams are
left as mere memories.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
It should never leave us in tears.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
When I wanted to pursue movies at my
age, people discouraged me.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
What they don’t understand is that I
am so in love with my dream that

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
No matter what age I am at, I
cannot let it go.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
We believe that every journey
leads to the destination.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
But some journeys stop even before
one reaches the destination.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
My journey is exactly like that.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
I am going back to Mumbai.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
From now on, no one needs to be
inconvenienced by me.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Arjun!

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Arjun!

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
There is no vehicle here...
What do we do now?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
What’s going on?

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Why is the train going back?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
It must be another take.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Another take?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
A movie shoot will have
a lot of takes.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Shooting?
What do you mean a movie shoot?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Hey, cut! Cut!

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Where is the hero?

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Where is the hero?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
That’s why we shouldn’t work with
new actors. -Stop it.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Let’s settle this first.
-Where is the hero?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Timing is really nice.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Place it in the take.
-Okay sir.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Did you not get on because
the train was going so fast?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Too fast?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
More than me?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Tell me what the scene is.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
The scene is that...

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Your girlfriend’s family got
to know about your relationship.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Her father is taking her to Kerala.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
You found out about it and you

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
immediately came to
the railway station.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
The villain keeps...

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
speeding... here.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Hey, come here.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Then, he catches him and
takes the knife that’s right there.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
And then cuts him.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
That’s it.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
The head flies off in the air and
before it falls down to the ground,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
the eagles swoops in and
takes the head off.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
The blood that flies along with
the head, lands on the green signal,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
turning it red.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
The train comes to a halt.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Awesome!

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
We are the first in India
to do this, right?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yes, sir.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
How do we go now?
-Let’s do something. Hold on.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Put them in the vehicles.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Johny, Johnny.
Yes, papa.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Hello, where to?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Outside.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
You’ve already committed to this.
Sit down.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
There is no commitment.
-Please, sit down.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
If not, we would be
chastened by the boss.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
I wonder where they drop in from.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Now, the heroine and you...

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
going to be acting out in a
very emotional scene.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Shall we go through the
dialogues once, sir?

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I’ll deliver in the take.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Since this morning, you’ve
been saying that

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
you’re going to deliver
the performance in the take

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
The time is 12 o’clock now.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
And nothing’s been delivered yet.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
If this continues, I don’t think
this movie is going to be made.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Listen...

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I’ll deliver the performance in
a single shot and single take.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Until I yell cut, if
anyone interferes,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I will kill them.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Ready?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Single shot, master.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Brothers....
Don’t send them away.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Cameramen are ready, sir.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Is the background ready?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Okay.
Ready sir!

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Start camera.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Action!

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Uncle?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Why did the train come to a halt
even though

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
you haven’t pulled the chain?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
While shooting the movie,
only the story goes to Mumbai.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
The train doesn’t.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Shooting?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Telling lies? No papa.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Even though you don’t want to
be in movies anymore,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
the industry doesn’t seem to
want to let you go.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Come, let’s go.
Everyone is waiting for you.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I won’t come.
You go.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Then, I wouldn’t be leaving either.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Arjun, listen to me.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Stop it!

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Uncle, you shouldn’t leave if there
is a problem.You must face it.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
If need be, you must resist it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
I will face any number of
people for you.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I will behead people for you.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
You don’t know about what
Salim Bhai can do, Arjun.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
If he wants to get
revenge that badly,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Don’t you love movies enough to
stand up and fight?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Just recollect the number of times
you were belittled and insulted

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
since the day you wanted
to become a hero.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
And imagine the amount of pain you
went through when you found that you

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
might never be able to
work in the movies.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
You were never scared of all those
insults.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And you say that you are
scared of that criminal?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Don’t be scared.
I am here.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Come.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Uncle, there is a dialogue.
-You!

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Uncle?
I am hero.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
You are heroine.
Let’s go.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Uncle, there’s a dialogue here.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Just stop it!

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
They are going to fix it somehow in
the dubbing. -Let’s go.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
They are here.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Salim Bhai!

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Move!

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Step aside!

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Get away from here!

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Step aside!

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Salim Bhai is alive.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
He is not dead.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Search for that idiot and
bring him out.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Who the hell are you?
That is my dialogue.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Dialogue?
Who is this ...?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Kill these idiots!

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Bhai, isn’t he the one
who deceived you?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Let’s kill him.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
How did you think you were going to
live after betraying Bhai?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Since the gun is ours, that man
must be one of our men.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Wasn’t it your talent that made Bhai
notice

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
you and cast you
in his biopic?

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
And what did you do?
You ruined the opportunity.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Okay.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
When your car got punctured,
you should have taken a cab.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
How did you go there with
the commissioner?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Bhai, we must kill him.
Kill him for sure.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Fine, you didn’t know that it was
the commissioner,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
And it was not your fault.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
But still, you must die.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Should we kill him, sir?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Bhai!

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Don’t believe him.
He puts on a very good act.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Yes, yes.
He acts very well.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Now, if we talk about his
performance... -Just shut up!

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Bhai, this guy is the one who was
always with him

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
and created
the whole mess.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
He was the one who changed the
photo in the courier.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Though we planned each time,
he was the one who kept saving him.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
He is the reason that that
fellow is still alive.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
What are you talking? I am the one
who responsible for everything.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
If he works in Telugu movies,
he should be the movie’s hero.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Who the hell are you,
you bloody fool?!

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
You’ve entered the scene at
the wrong time.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Who the hell are you guys?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
You’ve made a mess of my mind!
I will kill you all.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Who the hell are you?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
What the hell is going on?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
You speak Hindi.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Yes, I speak Hindi.
Salim Bhai.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
I am Telugu.
Baahubali.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Pan-India.
RRR.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Pan-India.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Pushpa!
Pan-India.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Boom Baddal.
Pan-India.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I am a pan-India star.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Bhai...

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
All these people are making us
fools! Shoot them all up!

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Don’t waste time.
Shoot them.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Don’t shoot, Arjun.
Arjun, listen to me.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Don’t do it.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Such a big gun?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
What the hell?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Don’t you know the difference
between a big gun and a small gun?

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
What?
-Bloody fool!

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Oh my god!
Mosquito spray?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Brother, look there.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Catch them!

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Shoot! Shoot!

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Step aside! Step aside!

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Why aren’t you reacting?!

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Reacting?

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Looking at my costume,
can’t you tell that I am a comedian?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Step aside!

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Arjun!

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Father!

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
You will die!

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Why would you do that, dear?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Arjun!

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Arjun!

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I am a hero.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
This is common in fighting.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
All you people who act in the
movies are all dummies.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
All the acting that you do is fake!

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
All your stunts are fake too!

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
The guns you use are fake too!

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And at last, even when
you guys are hit,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
the blood that
spills is fake too.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
You people just paint your faces.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
You are all dummies.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Yes, we are all dummies.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
But, unlike you, they don’t make
people go through hell.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Instead, they show them heaven.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
It might not be true.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
But movie actors make people laugh,
cry, dance and even fight.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
No matter what they do,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
they make the person who bought the
tickets will get enjoy thoroughly.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
They go to any lengths to
create that feeling.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
When people look at you,
they are vexed.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
But when they look at us, they laugh
and lengthen their life spans.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
What do you know about actors?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao.

        Instagram or Google the social media platform may send us your profile and social information such as Email ID,

      <p>i) publicly available sources such as public or open government databases or</p>
      <p>ii) online and offline data providers (including advertising networks and analytics providers).</p>
      <h2>Payment Card and Billing Information</h2>
      <p>When you purchase a subscription package using one or more of our payment gateway service providers, or any
        other online or mobile payment services provider we may use (including through any app stores), the following
        payment information will be collected: your credit/debit card details (number, card expiry date, CVC code) or
        other bank account details along with the date, time and amount of the transaction payment. This payment
        information is stored by our payment processors and associated with a merchant name/ID and location which our
        payment processor gives to us, together with a unique customer ID which we share with them but this payment
        information is never stored or processed by us. Our payment processors use this payment information to process
        and facilitate the payment of your subscription fee in order that we may provide you with the service you have
        requested or to enter into a contract with you to access the Platform (in other words to perform the contract).
        So that we know you have paid your subscription fee our payment processors will send us a unique transaction ID
        which we associate with your unique customer ID and which we keep for internal accounting purposes because we
        have a legal obligation to do so.</p>
      <p>Our payment processors may use third party fraud detection software or providers which analyse your payment
        information in order to make automated decisions as to whether or not payment from you will be accepted. You
        have the right to contest any fraud decision made about you and to be given more information about why any such
        decision was made by contacting us.</p>
      <p>Where you pay a third party for your subscription package (e.g. an app store like Apple App Store) your payment
        information is directly collected and controlled by that third party. However, we receive invoice receipts from
        third parties for your subscription purchase and these receipts are stored by us as we have a legitimate
        business interest to keep them for internal accounting and tax purposes and to comply with our legal obligation
        as per any applicable laws including any audits, legal proceedings and/or investigations.</p>
      <p>Where our payment processors are providing payment processing services to us we put in place appropriate
        contracts to protect your personal information. For the following aspects of the payment processing our payment
        processor may act as a controller of your payment information (identified and listed above): providing the
        payment processing services to you at your request,):, monitoring, preventing and detecting fraudulent payment
        transactions, complying with legal or regulatory obligations which apply to the financial services sector and
        analysing, developing and improving their products and services. Our payment processors have their own privacy
        policies in place and we recommend you read those policies before you provide your payment information.
      </p>
      <p>In order to process any of your customer support queries related to payment processing, our payment processors
        give us access to the first 6 digits and last 4 digits of your credit/debit card (including any updates) so that
        we can perform the contract with you and provide you with a quick resolution of your queries. We also use the
        first 6 digits of your credit/debit card so that, on the basis of our legitimate business interest, we can
        analyse the most popular card types and issuing banks of our customer base to ensure that we are able to improve
        our user experience and provide you better service. Our payment processors will also pass us your expiry date
        after each payment transaction is completed and we will use this to send you an email reminder to update your
        payment information before your card expires as we believe we have a legitimate interest to make sure your
        access to the Platform is not interrupted, you can still cancel at any time. However, at no point in time do we
        have access to or store the full credit/debit card number in our systems.</p>

        lawful basis for processing your Personal Information will vary depending on your country, the context in which
